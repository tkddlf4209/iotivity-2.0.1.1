Instruction:
1. Run the gbsbuild.sh with GBS-ROOT RPMS full directory
   Ex. sudo ./gbsbuild.sh /home/[USER]/GBS-ROOT/local/repos/redwood/armv7l/RPMS
2. It will extract the generated rpm and copy libgtest.a to bin/tizen folder

NOTE: If you don't provide GBS-ROOT RPMS full directory then it will still build and generate the rpm but can not
      copy the libgtest.a to the bin/tizen folder. In that case you have to manually extract and copy the libgtest.a
      to the bin/tizen folder. Otherwise ITC/UTC can not be built.
